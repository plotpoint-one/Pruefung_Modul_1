# Business card

Your task is to exactly recreate the Business Card as seen on this [image](https://i.imgur.com/tilxdwa.png). When you finish all of the tasks, the card must look the same as on the sample image.

## What are you going to learn?

- Understand and modify existing HTML and CSS code.
- Pick colors from an image.
- Use an online font library.

## Tasks

### Personal data
Replace the placeholder texts in `index.html` with your own data.

1. All data fields (name, title, phone, email, address) are replaced with the student's data, and the page still renders correctly.

### Render the image
Sadly, the Codecool logo is not rendered and you can assume the problem is in `index.html`. Find the problem and fix it.

1. The image is rendered properly on the left side of the card.

### Missing icons
Add the missing icons to the card.

1. The icon next to the name is this: https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/user-tie?s=solid.
2. The icon next to the phone number is this: https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/phone?s=solid.
3. The icon next to the email is this: https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/envelope-open?s=solid.
4. The icon next to the address is this: https://fontawesome.com/v5/icons/map-marker-alt?s=solid.

### Match colors
Use exactly the same colors as on the example picture.

1. The background color of the rectangle around the name is the same as in the example.
2. The background color on the right side of the card is the same as in the example.
3. The background color of the icons is the same as in the example.

## Hints
- Open `index.html` first to see the differences from the sample image. Understand the structure of the HTML document.
- You don't need to understand the CSS stylesheet completely, just find the places that need to be modified.
- There are multiple ways to steal pixel color information from an image. Try to do it from the browser.
