# Coin Toss

You argue with your colleague at work on who would get the parking space. Since both of you have the right to it you decided that a simple coint toss would be the best way to find out takes the spot. Being programmers, it's just to easy to use a normal coin flip so you have decided to write an app that does that for you :)


## What are you going to learn?

* change classes of HTML elements via JS
* change text of HTML elements via JS

## Tasks

### Change the text to state what coin side has been randomly chosen
The page should display what coin side was chosen

1. The paragraph with the id `message` should randomly display the text `You have chosen tails` or `You have chosen heads` each time the `index.html` page is loaded



### Display either the `heads` or `tails` image
The page should display either the `heads` or `tails` image each time the `index.html` page is loaded

1. When opening the `index.html` in a browser there should be only 1 image displayed. Refreshing the page in the browser should randomly change what image is displayed



## Hints

* In order to show or hide the image you can create a css class that sets the property `display: hidden` and then via javascript to add or remove it.
