# Tech Interview Workbook for Programming Basics in JS

This workbook forms the basis of the preparation for your upcoming tech interviews. We collected questions you can expect on real interviews (and therefore on the trial tech interview at the end of the course).

You need to fill in the answers in your workbook during your journey in the module. This means that you need to complete the workbook until your PA at the end of the module. We believe that thinking about and writing the answers will help you to understand the topics better than just reading around on the Internet.



## What are you going to learn?

## Hints
* Discuss your answers with each other! It is even better if you simulate an interview situation by shooting random questions at each other as it helps recalling the answers.
