## What are you going to learn?

* Use HTML headings, paragraphs, and lists

## Tasks

### Heading, paragraph, horizontal line
Create a basic HTML file named `index.html`. Extend the file to display your name as the title, followed by a horizontal line and a paragraph about yourself.

* Opening `index.html` with a web browser, it contains a name formatted as an `h1` level heading. Its font is bigger than the paragraph font.
* Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see a horizontal line separating the heading and the paragraph.
* Opening `index.html` with a web browser, the horizontal line below the heading has a width that is half of the screen (use `width: 50%`).
* Opening `index.html` with a web browser, below the heading there is a paragraph with a short introduction.

### Print your credentials
Extend the file with your personal details such as _City_, _Email address_, and _Telephone number_. All these properties should be in a different line with different font sizes.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see the city, email address, and phone number on a different line.
2. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see the these three lines (the city, email address, and phone number) rendered using different font sizes.

### Ordered & unordered lists
Extend the file with two lists. An ordered list should contain your favourite movies, and collect your favourite dishes in an unordered one.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see an ordered list with movie titles, containing at least 3 items.
2. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see an unordered list with dish names, containing at least 3 items.

### Display a list
Extend the file with a list containing 4 favourite actor names. Item 1 and 2 in the list should be underlined and items 3 and 4 should be italicized and bolded.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see at least 2 names which are underlined.
2. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see at least 2 names which are italicized and bolded.

### Abbreviations
Extend the file with five abbreviations of your choosing (e.g. food related, programming related), separated by empty lines. When you put the mouse over any abbreviation a tooltip (title attribute) should appear specifying in more detail what the abbreviation represents.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, when you put your mouse over an abbreviation you see a tooltip appears showing what it means.
2. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see 5 abbreviations.
3. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see empty lines between each abbreviation.

### Create 3 images
Extend the file with three different images. Each image should have an `alt` property and value.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser and inspecting in the developer tools you see one of the images is located on the user's computer (href is a relative path).
2. Opening `index.html` with a web browser and inspecting with the developer tools you see one of the images is located on the user's computer and in a different directory compared to the other images (href is a relative path in a subdirectory).
3. Opening `index.html` with a web browser and inspecting with the developer tools you see one of the images is linked from an outside source.
4. Opening `index.html` with a web browser and inspecting with the developer tools each image has an `alt` property and value.

### Clickable image
Choose an image from the previous task and make it clickable.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, and left clicking on one of the images a new tab is opened.

### Tables
Extend the file with a table with 3 rows and 3 columns. Merge the first and second column from row 3. Merge row1 and row 2 from column 3. Each cell should contain the name of a person.

1. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see a table with 7 cells in total.
2. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see a table where the 3rd row has column 1 and column 2 merged.
3. Opening `index.html` with a web browser, you see a table where the 3rd column has row 1 and row 2 merged.

## Hints
- Most of the HTML tags need to have an opening and closing tag, if you forget to add it, you might observe strange artifacts when it is rendered
- To see HTML code in the browser right-click anywhere in a page and select Inspect
