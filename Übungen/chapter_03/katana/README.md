# KATANA

Welcome to the matrix. Your goal is to liberate yourself out of it. Do you have the sharpest KATANA to do so?

## What are you going to learn?

* JavaScript katas
* HTML/CSS basics

## Tasks

KATANA is a monthly tournament. Whole winning team obtains eternal fame and liberty from the chains of the Matrix. Teams compete against eachother and the one with the highest score wins.

All team members register on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) and will practice JavaScript katas. Only katas done in the week of the tournament do count. Each team member has a score. This score is the sum of each `finished kata / kyu of the kata`. The score of the whole team is the sum of all scores of the `individual scores / number of team members`.

### Task1

* Prepare a visually attractive HTML/CSS presentation for the Friday - demo day. Make sure to include at lest the following:
  * Intro of the team 
  * Plan for the week
  * Difficulties encountered while battling through the katas
  * Lessons learned
  * Page for each team member showing his total score and a table with all the katas finished incl. their kyu rank.
  * Page for the whole team with its final score

### Task2

* Finish as many katas as possible

## Hints

* Split so there is at least two teams. Ideally all of the teams are 2 - 3 persons.
* Creating a nice HTML presentation will take some time. Plan for this before. Prepare it before you start with the katas, so you only fill it out with proper information before the end.
* Each team member must be ready to understand and thus explain his own solutions. There might be som random test to check if you've really come up your solutions yourself. Failure to do so will result in disqualification of the entire team.
* Use bootstrap or tailwind CSS libraries to make your presentation look beautiful easily.
